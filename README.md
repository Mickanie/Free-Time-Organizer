#Free Time Organizer

A Trello-inspired board to list all the things to read/watch/play in free time.
It allows to add new things into 4 tables: movies, series, books and games
Data is stored using Local Storage
Things can be set "done" and deleted from the list.

#Work in progress
#Planned developments: 
Customizing: adding new tables of chosen content - partly done

Code refactoring
